# Commons Simulator

![Commons Simulator](public/simulator.jpg)

The Commons Simulator is a community project funded entirely by Gitcoin Grants, and undertaken by the Commons Stackâ€™s dDev team. The Commons Simulator blends art and simulation into a dystopian sci-fi future where you travel back in time with cadCAD, a complex systems simulator that can predict the future.

You use cadCAD to help the fledgling RadicalxChange movement to customize their Cyber-Physical Commons to suit the needs of their community and save the world from ecosystem collapse!
